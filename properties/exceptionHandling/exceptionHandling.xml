		<description>
			This factory is used to create beans in charge of handling the exceptions 
			thrown by the application. It must implement interface 
			org.esupportail.commons.services.exceptionHandling.ExceptionServiceFactory.
			By default, exception reports are also sent to an archived bugs mailing list,
			accessible to the developers of the project only. This feature is used to be 
			warned of all the possible exceptions occuring on the applciation anywhere; 
			this way, most bugs can be corrected as soon as they happen. If you do not 
			want the exceptions to be sent to this list, you can manually set property 
			doNotSendExceptionReportsToDevelopers to true.
			esup-lecture developers are ready and pleased to help you through the support
			mailing lists, please help them to improve the application by sending them 
			the exception reports. Thanks!
